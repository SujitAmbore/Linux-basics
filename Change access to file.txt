Summary:
In this section, I will discuss some of the commands which are related to permission managment in Linux, These commands helps a user to define access-control to files.

Command: ls -l
Purpose: To see all the permissions to different files, above command will lists the files in the working directory in long format.

Example: username@machine Documents % ls -l

Output:
total 2
-rw-r--r--@  1 username  staff      0 Oct 22 11:32 file1.txt
drwxr-xr-x   6 username  staff    192 Aug  3 14:46 Folder

r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.
d       Directory

Command: chmod [reference][operator][mode] file...  
Purpose: Change Mode command is used to change the access mode of a file.


Example: BEFORE: -rw-rw-r--  mik  mik  assgn1_client.c
COMMAND: chmod u=r assgn1_client.c
Output: -r--rw-r--  mik   mik   assgn1_client.c

The references are used to distinguish the users to whom the permissions apply i.e. they are list of letters that specifies whom to give permissions. The
references are represented by one or more of the following letters:

Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo

Command: chmod [reference][operator][mode] file...  
Purpose: To change user permision to view Directory.

Example: 
BEFORE: drwxrwxr-x  mik   mik   EXAM
COMMAND: chmod u=rw EXAM
AFTER: drw-rwxr-x   mik  mik    EXAM

After applying the chmod u=rw EXAM command, the user (owner) cannot change the directory. If the user tries to change the directory, then it shows the message “Permission denied”
